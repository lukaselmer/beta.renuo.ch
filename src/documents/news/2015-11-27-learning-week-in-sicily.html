<p><i>We learnt a lot about software engineering and programming. We improved ourselves as a team. We decided as a team in which
  directions our company should develop and which tools we would like to work with to be efficient. We searched for solutions how our work
  can generate the highest value for our customers.</i></p>

<p>We are back from Sicily. Sicily? Yes, we were in Italy, but rather than just to have a relaxing week of vacation, we decided to organize a
learning week together and bring Renuo further. Therefore, we’d like to tell you something about the week and the resulted values for our
clients.</p>

<p>Since Renuo is growing and we are twice the persons compared to last year, we had to think about organizational processes for being more
efficient in managing the daily tasks. Moreover the technical knowledge of each programmer is very important to us. Because we have a lot of
different talents in our team, we wanted to arrange a knowledge exchange to reach that goal.</p>

<p>Out of our evaluation of the week resulted, that we were really productive, it was great for our team cohesion, learned a lot, all had
really fun and are really motivated to get better.</p>

<p>But now more about our week…</p>

<p>Day #1 was our travelling day from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/81bPVvvaAvs">Zürich Airport to Catania (I)</a> where we continued driving to our bungalow by car. The organizers
presented the scheduled program and we figured out a community agreement with our rules for living together. By the way we also cooked
ourselves; therefore every day a team of a few persons was responsible for the daily shopping.</p>
