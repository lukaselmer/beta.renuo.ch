<p>After last yearâ€™s successful Learning Week in Sicily, we organised a second Learning Week in Lisbon. The goal was, to strengthen our team spirit, get to know the new team members, discuss the future of our company and freshen our technical skills. Therefore we lived together at <a href="https://www.thesurfoffice.com/">Surf Office</a> in Lisbon, the heart of Portugal, for one week. </p>
<p>During the time abroad we had several workshops and blocks either technique or company related which were organised by team members.
For example discussions regarding organisational questions like team organisation and general tasks, due our company's growth, brought new insight on how we will proceed and organise ourselves in the future.
We also improved our skills in blocks where we repeated the basics of software engineering and others where we researched about new and arising technologies and project organisation methodologies which resulted in interesting internal presentations of our team members.</p>
<p>Everyone could bring in his ideas during the discussion about the wages- and bonus system or the workshop regarding our company's values, with the goal that everyone understands them and that we as a team extend and modernise the meaning and our understanding of these values.</p>
<p>At the code retreat workshop we pair-programmed the same task with different colleagues for a whole day and teached new ways and learned a lot from each other. In a different workshop we looked closely at the tools we use everyday and got to know them better to work as efficient as possible. We also used the time to review on the last year to exchange and talk about good such as bad project experiences.</p>
<p>The evenings often included social activities. The days we had dinner inside another group cooked delicious dinner for 14 people. Afterwards we either had leisure time or played board games. Three times we went out for dinner and enjoyed portuguese specialities.
  To not miss Lisbon at daylight we also took a day off to go surfing and sightseeing.</p>
<p>Now back in Switzerland - We are even more motivated, well prepared for more technical challenges and with many different impressions of the Learning Week.
