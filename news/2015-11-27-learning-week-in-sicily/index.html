            <p><i>We learnt a lot about software engineering and programming. We improved ourselves as a team. We decided as a team
  in which
  directions our company should develop and which tools we would like to work with to be efficient. We searched for
  solutions how our work
  can generate the highest value for our customers.</i></p>

<p>We are back from Sicily. Sicily? Yes, we were in Italy, but rather than just to have a relaxing week of vacation, we
  decided to organize a
  learning week together and bring Renuo further. Therefore, we’d like to tell you something about the week and the
  resulted values for our
  clients.</p>

<p>Since Renuo is growing and we are twice the persons compared to last year, we had to think about organizational
  processes for being more
  efficient in managing the daily tasks. Moreover the technical knowledge of each programmer is very important to us.
  Because we have a lot of
  different talents in our team, we wanted to arrange a knowledge exchange to reach that goal.</p>

<p>Out of our evaluation of the week resulted, that we were really productive, it was great for our team cohesion,
  learned a lot, all had
  really fun and are really motivated to get better.</p>

<p>But now more about our week…</p>

<p><img align="right" src="/images/news/sicily15/sicily15_0.jpg" alt="Departure in Zürich"/><b>Day #1</b> was our
  travelling day from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/81bPVvvaAvs">Zürich Airport to
    Catania (I)</a>
  where we continued
  driving to our bungalow by car. The organizers presented the scheduled program and we figured out a community
  agreement with our rules for
  living together. By the way we also cooked
  ourselves; therefore every day a team of a few persons was responsible for the daily shopping.</p>


<p><img align="right" src="/images/news/sicily15/sicily15_1.jpg" alt="The pool of our bungalow"/><b>Day #2</b> started
  with each of us selecting a new technology, doing research and present it to the others. Like
  that, we could get a short insight into a lot of interesting new stuff, discuss it and can now follow up the
  interesting ones. The afternoon was spent for organizational questions, how we can organize ourselves in a
  sustainable concept which scales also if we grow further. Also for this task, we split up in teams for finding
  solutions and combined them in the afterwards.</p>

<p><img align="left" src="/images/news/sicily15/sicily15_6.jpg" alt="Preparing lunch together"/>The morning of <b>Day
  #3</b> started with repeating some common principles of software development used to write good
  software. Like this, we could think again about our very important values when developing software. Before the week
  we decided to release a project in the week together. Being many engineers, it’s reasonable to split such a project in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservices</a>. So we continued with a
  clarification about the understanding of microservices and a discussion about
  the pros and cons. We found a consensus in developing an internal dashboard to overview tasks, reminders, the status
  of projects and so on. So we collected ideas, split the tasks up to each of us and after that we were ready to start
  with the project in the afternoon.</p>

<p><img src="/images/news/sicily15/sicily15_3.jpg" alt="Hiking on Etna"/><b>Day #4</b> started earlier than usual,
  because we wanted to go hiking. After having eaten a quick bite during
  these early hours, we hopped into our little cars and navigated towards the 3’350 m high, intimidatory monstrosity
  called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BVfnDbQuHAN2">Mt Etna</a>.<br/>
  Once we arrived at the base station of the bubble lift, we observed the small gondolas vanishing in the fog, and we
  asked ourselves whether we chose the wrong day for our hiking trip. Nevertheless we hurdled our gloomy thoughts and
  soon found ourselves surrounded by near-solid haze, which could have been sliced through by our Swiss army knifes.
  <img src="/images/news/sicily15/sicily15_4.jpg" alt="Renuo group selfie"/>Arriving at the interstation we set our
  goal: to climb up the the mountain together as a team. This was challenging
  since some of our team were very eager to rush up the mountain, while others needed more time to slowly creep upwards.
  Fast-forward to three hours later: we reached the top without losing a single member of our team - impressive! What
  was also astonishing was that when we dug a 30 cm hole, the earth became hot - Mt Etna really must be a volcano. So
  after digging random holes, we searched for a nice place to have lunch, where we unpacked our sandwiches and cosily
  ate our meal. After lunch we started our descent, which went really well for everyone. Of course we were already
  forging new ideas on the way down, and once we arrived at our bungalow, we were keen to having an intellectual
  challenge again. And that was exactly what we did: we discussed the so called
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)">GRASP patterns</a> by preparing
  each pattern
  in a small group, and thereafter presenting the pattern in front of the whole team. While this exercise was a
  repetition for most of us, it showed once again how valuable these lectures were at the university, and that these
  patterns and principles cannot be embraced enough during our daily software development.</p>
<p><img align="right" src="/images/news/sicily15/sicily15_5.jpg" alt="Learning Session"/>On <b>Day #5</b> we focused on
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smells</a>
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">code refactoring</a>, which will help us
  building solid systems during the
  daily
  business without getting into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical
    debt</a> - or in other words help us being consistently fast during software
  development. Furthermore, we established a common sense in our team about software engineering and its architecture.
  We followed this up by working on our weekly project, where we already discovered some bad smells, which needed to be
  refactored. In the afternoon, we reached out to find tools for our daily work considering project management and our
  Scrum processes. We did that by conducting a short brainstorming together, and then individually or in small groups
  trying out new tools which each of us found interesting. This was rather difficult to achieve since our internet
  access bandwidth was limited. Despite these difficulties, we discovered and researched a large variety of (new) tools,
  from which we found some tools which we would like to examine in more detail, namely
  <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/">JIRA</a>,
  <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs">Visual Studio
    Online</a>,
  <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/"
                                                                                      >Trello</a>. In
  the future, we hope that
  this workshop will serve as a basis so we can use the right
  tools for the job, and effectively serve our customers better. Last but not least, we also tested <a
    href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, which seems
  to be a great tool for team and project communication.
  Later in the evening we visited the beautiful city of Catania, where we had a nice apéro around a tree stub. After a
  cozy dinner, the evening ended for some of us, while the rest of our team had a great time enjoying the nightlife of
  Catania.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Day #6</b> started with a well prepared brunch, which was really tasty. Our goal of this day was to conclude the
  organizational part of the week. Whilst the opinions of how our company should be organized were very diverse at the
  beginning of the week, a common understanding emerged during the week, so that our opinions converged into a single
  mindset. This was relieving for all of us, and we are looking forward to improving our way of working and providing
  not only more value to our customers, but also to our employees. Later in the evening, we refreshed the vision,
  <a href="/ueber-uns/#our-values">mission and values</a>, which all our employees at Renuo live.
</p>
<p>
  The <b>Day #7</b> was a very interesting day. We did a so-called Code Retreat, which is solving the same problem
  multiple
  times in different groups, and presenting each solution in front of the whole team. Because the same problem was
  tackled multiple times, after some round all engineers understood the business problem by heart, which allowed them to
  fully focus on the technical side of things. Furthermore, it enforced creativity by repeating a single task multiple
  times. It was also interesting to experience pair programming from different positions, and learning how to
  communicate with each other. Finally, the solutions later on were much leaner and cleaner, because everyone could
  profit from each other's knowledge. In conclusion, this exercise vastly helped spreading our already existing
  knowledge. As a team, we feel competent and confident that together we will tackle even the hardest technical problems
  in our bright looking future.
</p>
<p>
  On <b>Day #8</b> we started the morning preparing everything for our travels back. After breakfast, we cleaned up the
  house
  and packed everything in our bags that we could carry. Some things which could be useful for the next rentee of the
  house were left there, like spices and extra virgin olive oil. After leaving our
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Pnj6WawqXJ32">beautiful mansion</a>, we travelled
  together to Catania, where we headed for a shopping mall near the airport to spend our last hours in Sicily. Next, we
  travelled to the airport, returned our cars and printed our e-Tickets at the check-in desk. Finally we boarded the
  flight to Zurich and took off: “Ciao ciao Sicilia!”. Two hours later, we arrived in Zurich, and we concluded that it
  was a great, but also a very tough week. We learnt a lot about organizing, trusting in each other, getting better and
  faster at architecting and programming, and we are looking forward to utilize the newly gathered knowledge during our
  daily work!
